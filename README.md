# Hi, Iâ€™m Andy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a rising senior student at Western University in London, Ontario currently studying
an honours double major in accounting and applied statistics. I enjoy using languages such as Python and SQL, 
and I am currently learning R and C++ too. 

I hope to have a lasting career in quant finance and am currently working towards building relevant skills.
